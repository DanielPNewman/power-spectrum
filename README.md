# power_spectrum

Michel and Ralph!
See the power_spectrum.m file here. This is where I got to with this analysis today. And this is where I’ll pass it over for you guys to have some fun with.... :-D
Don't forget that you'll have to download the EEGLAB toolbox for matlab because the script above uses functions from there. You can download EEGLAB for free from here: http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/install.html
The other few files in this repo (e.g. loadbvSK_DN, etc.) are needed because they are called by  power_spectrum.m

So, you’ll have to learn how to use github. If I were you I’d download and install the github-desktop user-interface from here  https://desktop.github.com/  There are detailed instructions on how to use it here https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/ 
So once you have set up gitbub, you’ll need to “Fork” this repository over into your own repository to make changes
